.SH DESCRIPTION
Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) is an industrial scale blockchain platform that cryptographically ensures data integrity and proves time of existence. Its keyless signatures, based on hash chains, link data to global calendar blockchain.
The checkpoints of the blockchain, published in newspapers and electronic media, enable long term integrity of any digital asset without the need to trust any system.
.LP
Log signature tool is specifically designed to add KSI signature to any type of logs. It enables log signing, signature extending and verifying.
